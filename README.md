# Language Agnostic Version Alert System

This repo contains a Language Agnostic Github Automation suite, which utilizes Github APIs to send alerts regarding outdated project dependencies.

## Documentation

The automation suite currently, supports the following languages/files.
* Node (package.json)
* Python (requirements.txt)
* Java - Maven (pom.xml)
* Java - Gradle (build.gradle)
* Ruby (Gemfile)
* Swift (package.swift)
* Rust (cargo.toml)
* PHP (composer.json) {Under Development}
* C# (packages.config) {Under Development}
  

## Workflow 

- Generate Alert by checking repo files and determining the languages used 
- The languages are then checked with the database of standard packages present, for example, python matches with requirements.txt and ruby matches with Gemfile
- Once the incident Alert (issue) is closed using "~UPD" tag followed by package files you need to keep track of, another version dependency alert is generated by looking into the package file and checking for outdated dependencies.
